# nand2tetris-go
This repository contains a golang implementation for the [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course project 6 
(the Assembler). The assembler is a program that translates programs written in the symbolic Hack assembly language 
into binary code that can execute on the Hack hardware platform. Since I was picking up Golang at the same time of 
following the nand2tetris course, I decided to implement the assembler in Golang. I don't know all best-practices and 
design principles in golang yet, so I'm sure there are many things that could be improved.
